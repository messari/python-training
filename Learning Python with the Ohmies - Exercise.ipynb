    "TLDR this runs install commands directly from this notebook and installs what you need into this specific enviornment. If you open a new jupyter notebook and want to use the messari library, you'll likely have to do this again. This only needs to be done once per notebook to set up the library, once you've run this code in a notebook you won't have to run it again. This is not how I recomend installing the messari library but in the interest of time I'm confident this will fix most of your problems. If you want to try and wrangle through these issues on your specific computer and install the messari library the right way, hit me up and we can do a screen share sesh at another time"
